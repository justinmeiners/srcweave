; Weave: Make readable documentation from .lit file.
; We have chosen HTML for it's support for many media types and readability
; on many devices.

; DESIGN
; One-to-one correspondence between .lit and .html files.
; The body of an .html file should look the same regardless of whether the .lit is in another context (like a book).

# Literate commands

This document will teach you the basic commands of literate, while also acting as a test for all the basic features that are available.
One of the great advantages of literate programming is that information and code like this are combined into one useful form.

## Including blocks

Literate programming is about decomposing code into blocks and then composing them.
The fundamental operation is block inclusion.

For this example, we are going to use more complex example than "hello world"
in order to test multiple inclusion levels.

One way to design programs is to focus on algorithms and data structures.

--- program design
@{data structures}

@{algorithms}
---

But of course we have all this other stuff we have to worry about that the compiler needs.
--- /sample.c
@{includes}

@{program design}

@{tests}
---

For this sample, we will make a linked list:

--- data structures
typedef struct ListNode
{
    int val;
    struct ListNode *next;
} ListNode;
---

An important algorithm is the length: 

--- algorithms 
int list_length(ListNode* head)
{
    int n = 0;
    while (head)
    {
       ++n;
       head = head->next;
    }
    return n;
}
---

Here is a test for the algorithm:

--- test length algorithm
ListNode* c = malloc(sizeof(ListNode));
c->val = 3;
c->next = NULL;

ListNode* b = malloc(sizeof(ListNode));
b->val = 2;
b->next = c;

ListNode* a = malloc(sizeof(ListNode));
a->val = 1;
a->next = b;

printf("%d\n", list_length(a));
---

All of this will run in a C main loop:

--- tests
int main()
{
   @{test length algorithm};
}
---

Lastly, there are some boring headers to include.

--- includes
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
---

We can reference blocks in prose.
Note that @{algorithms} is `O(n)`.

We can also link to chapters and sections.
This link leads back up to [the Including blocks](@Including blocks) section.

## Formatting and whitespace

Outputing source code that looks the way you expect is important.
So, let's look at some formatting details.

We can include blocks by name.
Even though we have multiple includes here, it should all be one line,
because the block contents are a single line.

--- /whitespace/multiple-include.c
int array[] = { @{num 1}, @{num 2} };
---

--- num 1
1
---

--- num 2
2
---

If we include a block with multiple lines, it should include all of them.
The included lines should be padded with the whitespace of the include statement.

--- /whitespace/multiline-include.c
int nums[] = {
    @{all numbers}
};
---

--- all numbers
1,
2,
3,
4,
5
---

Also, notice that block paths can include directory components
and these will be created automatically.


Blocks can be empty:

--- empty block
---

Files can be empty:
--- /touchfile
---

## Block operators

We can define blocks in parts by appending them together.
For example, every C program starts with a header.
--- /append.c
#include <stdio.h>
---

Then we have a main signature.
--- /append.c += 
int main(int argc, const char* argv[])
---

Then the body:
--- /append.c +=
{
    printf("Hello, World!");
    return 0;
}
---

Which one does @{/append.c} refer to?

We can also redefine blocks.
One usage of this is to progressively refine a piece of code.
Let's look at a classic function
--- /redefine.c
#include <assert.h>

@{factorial}

int main() {
   return (factorial(4) != 24);
}
---

Here is a possible implementation
--- factorial
int factorial(int n)
{
    if (n <= 0) return 1;
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
}
--- 
This is pretty hard on the stack, so let's try a loop version:
--- factorial :=
int factorial(int n)
{
    int acc = 1;
    while (n > 0)
    {
        acc *= n;
        --n;
    }
    return acc;
}
---
The block above should be using the final definition.

## Modifiers 

Notice also that it's not necessary to use a file extension, or
for all the code in a file to be of the same type..
For example `makefile` and other shell scripts can be 
authored.

--- /no-extension ---
#!/bin/sh
echo "Hello, World!"
---

Sometimes you have a block that's important for source, but too boring to include in the documentation.
You can use the modifier `noWeave` for these.
Here is one:
--- /hidden.c --- noWeave
int boring_function() 
{
    return 10;
}
----
But, you will notice it does not appear in the documentation.
References to @{/hidden.c} will not have references.

## Escaping the include syntax "@{...}"

In code blocks and prose, the @ sign followed by an open and close brace is typically parsed as a code block reference. You can use a double @ sign to escape from that functionality. When weaving/tangling, the double "@@" gets replaced by a single "@".

--- Escape-includes
(defvar includes-regex "@@{\\(\w+\\)}")
---

--- /escaped.lisp
@{Escape-includes}
---
